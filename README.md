EcoSustain is a platform dedicated to the responsible recycling and management of electronic waste (e-waste). The project aims to bridge the gap between users and recycling facilities, making it easier to dispose of electronic waste sustainably. Users can locate nearby recycling facilities, send recycling requests, earn rewards, and learn more about e-waste management.
